# What I Learned from Star 3
You can't read in a comma separated file the same way you'd read in a newline
separated file. I had save the input in a .csv file rather than a .txt file
this time, and read it in using a different function with different parameters
1. Comma separated files are much different from .txt
2. When dealing with input that assumes 0 indexed, arrays, you do need to
compensate for R
3. A bit more about indexing and vectors
4. You can actually edit a function after creating it in the interpreter using
the edit function
