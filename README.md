# Advent of R
I'm taking this month to become comfortable with R and enjoy the advent of code 
event.

## What is the Advent of Code?
Most people using GitHub have probably heard of it before, but 
[here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) is an explanation by the creator.
It's essentially an advent calendar but instead of each day holding a new gift,
each day holds a new programming question. So if you really like programming, I
guess each day really does hold a new gift for you. 

## My Approach
I'm starting this on December 3rd, and I have never used R before. That said,
the first two days are not that difficult, and I do have a couple years of 
programming experience already. So hopefully, I'll be able to learn R at a
quick enough pace to keep up with the diffferent concepts presented in each
day's puzzle. 

Since this is my first time working with the language and I am starting from
behind, these solutions will probably not be elegant / efficient by any means.
What I do to solve each problem is that I use the R interpreter to mess around
with new ideas and get comfortable with new features of R. Once I find
something that works, I'll copy over my solution to a .R file and document it
so that I can share it here.
